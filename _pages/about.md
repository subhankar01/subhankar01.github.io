I am Subhankar Sen, a final year Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Manipal University Jaipur, India. 

My primary research objective and interest inhere at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, with the intent of developing meaningful insights for image and video understanding tasks. My undergraduate research experience to date encompasses fields such as Medical Imaging, Human Action Recognition, Temporal Activity Localization, and Surgical Robotics. In addition, my past experiences have given me ample scope for exploring and developing a solid grasp of generative learning and multimodal analysis. My long-term goal is to build machines ingrained with a sense of vision and perception that will enable them to one day understand the world as seamlessly and intuitively as humans and other living creatures do. Additionally, my future research interests lie in extending my skills and knowledge to a multitude of applications in transportation, retail, sports, surveillance systems, and autonomous robotics.
